# TYCHE

For the Codex integration that runs inside the Leadpoet lab, see
[Leadpoet lab integration](docs/leadpoet-arena.md). It uses the lab runtime
from subnet PR #198 and returns reviewed JSON through `harness.run_icp(icp)`.

**Open-source lead sourcing with evidence, verified contacts, and spending controls.**

TYCHE finds companies that match your ideal customer profile, checks the facts
and buying signals you care about, then finds people in your requested roles.
It runs in Codex and delivers an Excel lead list, structured JSON, and an audit
report with sources and costs.

## What it does

- **Qualifies companies first.** Checks company fit and buying signals separately,
  preserving required criteria, preferences, and missing evidence.
- **Finds the right people.** Verifies current roles and company identity, with
  primary and fallback role groups when requested.
- **Validates email.** Requires a verified email by default, with explicit opt-outs
  and receipt-backed validation.
- **Controls run spending.** Stops new paid work at the observed provider-plus-model
  cutoff and keeps the same budget and receipts through interruptions.

- **Offers optional parallel research.** File-based runs use one researcher by
  default. Choose `--workers 2` or `--workers 3` for the same workflow with exclusive
  company claims and one shared budget; see [parallel research](docs/codex-isolated-testing.md#parallel-company-research).
- **Saves confirmed leads as it goes.** Updates `leads.json` after each evidence
  review, so a partial list is available before the full target is reached.
- **Delivers traceable results.** Saves accepted, rejected, and unresolved outcomes;
  validates the result and workbook before delivery.

## Quick start

### 1. Prepare your environment

You need:

- [Codex CLI](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/codex/cli) on `PATH`, with a reusable
  file-based login (`codex login`). You can submit requests from Codex desktop.
- Python 3.10 or later, plus an installed, authenticated Deepline CLI for provider
  research, LinkedIn verification, and email validation.
- The Codex workbook runtime: Node.js, Python, and `@oai/artifact-tool`. The launcher
  discovers the installed desktop bundle. Other hosts must configure the
  [runtime paths](docs/codex-isolated-testing.md#workbook-finalization-and-usage-reconciliation)
  before sourcing; installing the Codex CLI alone does not supply the exporter.
- A `SCRAPINGDOG_API_KEY` if you want to use ScrapingDog routes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gzaentz/tyche.git
cd tyche
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
deepline health --json
```

Deepline executions use the direct API with `DEEPLINE_API_KEY` or the existing
production SDK login, preserving raw error responses and billing IDs. Custom
CLI configurations retain their CLI transport. Catalog discovery still uses
the CLI; a separate ZeroBounce key is unnecessary. Export `SCRAPINGDOG_API_KEY`
to enable ScrapingDog. Set `DEEPLINE_BIN` to the executable's absolute path if it
is outside `PATH`.

Local `.env` files are **not loaded automatically**. In a Bash or Zsh terminal,
load your own file before starting Codex:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
```

Keep credentials out of committed files.

Use that same Python environment for the launcher. Native tools and the
`run_attempt.py` CLI check provider inputs against the saved live JSON Schema,
including nested fields, before paid dispatch. Describe the tool in the run first.
An invalid input returns its field path and constraint for correction; no paid
request or spending reservation is created. Unresolved provider bills still
block further paid work.

### 2. Check the launcher

Install the same released Codex client used by Arena without changing your global CLI:

```sh
npm install --prefix .runtime --no-audit --no-fund --save-exact @openai/codex@0.154.0
```

The launcher checks the version. `TYCHE_CODEX_BINARY` may select another installation
of that exact version. Local and Arena execution call the same supervisor in
`scripts/codex_tyche.py`; see [the Arena adapter](docs/leadpoet-arena.md).

Run this from your regular host terminal:

```bash
python3 scripts/codex_tyche.py --check
```

This checks isolation and session startup without a model turn or provider
calls. It does not verify model-service connectivity or provider credentials.
Use `--smoke` for an optional read-only model response with no provider calls.
See [launcher setup and troubleshooting](docs/codex-isolated-testing.md).

The [launcher](scripts/codex_tyche.py) pins **`gpt-5.6-luna`**, **`high` reasoning**
and the **`fast` service tier**. It loads project-local sourcing instructions in
an isolated session while retaining the worker's sandbox and network policy.
Before any model turn, it checks the pinned Codex model list and refuses an
unsupported model, reasoning effort, speed tier, or silent fallback.
`TYCHE_MODEL=gpt-6-luna` selects the priced candidate for an isolated local
comparison. Arena stays pinned to the default model, and a resumed run must use
the model recorded in its receipts.

### 3. Ask for leads

Open this repository in Codex and describe the companies, signals, roles, and
budget you want. For example:

```text
Source 5 US B2B SaaS companies with 50–500 employees. Exclude agencies and
consultancies. Each must have posted at least 3 sales openings in the last
30 days. Find one CRO, VP Sales, or Head of Sales with a verified work email
at each accepted company. Spend at most $5 total on sourcing providers.
```

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) routes sourcing requests through the isolated launcher
and saves each request under `reports/<run-id>/request.txt`. Code changes and
questions stay in your ordinary Codex session.

For a terminal-driven run, create a unique directory under `reports/`, save your
request and that directory path in a UTF-8 `request.txt`, then run from the host
terminal, replacing `<run-id>` with your directory name:

```bash
python3 scripts/codex_tyche.py --exec-file reports/<run-id>/request.txt
```

## Requests and defaults

| Setting | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Companies | Give a target count, geography, industry, size, and exclusions. Distinguish must-haves from preferences. |
| Buying signals | Specify the evidence and date window. Required signals match **any** by default; ask for **all** when each is mandatory. |
| Contacts | One contact per company by default; request up to three. You can name primary roles and fallback roles. |
| Contact data | Verified email by default. Explicitly request no email or phone (`contact_fields: []`) to opt out, or request phone only. |
| Run budget | **$0.80 × requested leads** when omitted. Reported provider charges plus estimated base LLM cost. An explicit budget, including zero, overrides this default. |
| Time | Two hours by default. An explicit time limit overrides it; speed benchmarks do not. Resuming preserves the original clock. |

Every stored email must pass ZeroBounce or its eligible BounceBan fallback,
with matching receipts. Accepted contacts require verified LinkedIn country;
company size uses the published LinkedIn employee range. See the
[input and output contract](.agents/skills/lead-sourcing/references/output-contract.md)
for exact fields and evidence rules.

New runs use one **soft cost cutoff**: provider charges plus estimated
base LLM usage. Completed ScrapingDog requests use documented endpoint tariffs;
variable or unresolved calls retain a separate documented ceiling against the budget. Check after each response and before further paid work. Calls
already running can take the final total above the threshold. Missing billing
without a documented ceiling pauses new paid work; it is never treated as free.
The report separates provider charges, tariff holds, estimated LLM cost and pending calls.
Old ledgers retain their original reservation policy. Request IDs, receipts,
original limits and duplicate-call protection survive every continuation.

TYCHE continues until it meets the qualified target, cannot fund further required
work, or reaches the saved deadline. Exhausted searches require a strategy change;
an early worker exit automatically continues the same saved run. Genuine runtime
or access failures stay blocked, not completed. Shortfalls remain visible. It does not send
outreach or write to a CRM.

## Outputs

Each run saves its files under `reports/<run-id>/`:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `leads.json` | Continuously saved confirmed companies and contacts, with evidence, target, count, and update time. Available during research. |
| `leads.xlsx` | One row per verified contact at each accepted company, with shared company details, signals and intent, plus a **Sources** worksheet. |
| `results.json` | Versioned accepted, rejected, and unresolved records with evidence and accounting. |
| `report.md` | Human-readable findings, shortfalls, decisions, sources, and provider costs. |
| `run-costs.json` | Provider and isolated-worker model usage/cost summary, including estimates and missing usage. |

The run also retains validation, workbook previews, provider receipts, and
`results.json.budget.json`. Keep the entire directory to resume with the same
scope and accounting. Model cost excludes the outer development conversation.

Delivery requires the full validator to return **`delivery_allowed: true`**,
a verified saved workbook, and review of its preview. A process exit or model
message alone does not establish completion. Partial files remain progress
artifacts until they pass the delivery checks.

To consume confirmed leads during research, read the `leads` array in `leads.json`.
An atomic replacement keeps readers from seeing a half-written file. Unfinished
candidates stay in `results.json`; later research failures preserve the confirmed
list. Changed or withdrawn leads are removed until reviewed again. The JSON does
not wait for all requested leads or for the final Excel export. See the
[confirmed JSON contract](.agents/skills/lead-sourcing/references/output-contract.md#leadsjson-confirmed-leads).
The bundled arena adapter publishes those confirmed leads to
`/output/companies.json` on approval, so cost/time cutoffs can retain a partial list.

## Build on TYCHE

Codex chooses sources, queries, follow-ups, and qualification judgments. Local
Python tools handle execution, observed-cost checks, receipts, and validation;
the Node exporter builds the workbook.

```text
Request → isolated Codex session → research and evidence review
                                → provider adapters + budget ledger
                                → strict validation → JSON / report / Excel
```

File-backed runs expose five native tools over local MCP:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tyche_start` | Initialize or resume the request, combined cost cutoff. |
| `tyche_lookup` | Run a selected provider tool or up to three independent checks; record spending and save receipts. |
| `tyche_review` | Save findings, review completed leads, and automatically update confirmed JSON on approval. |
| `tyche_inspect` | Read saved state, discover tools, and inspect schemas, pricing, or receipts. |
| `tyche_finish` | Validate reviewed results, export and verify the workbook, and write the report. |

### Where to work

| Change | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Research behavior and qualification | [Sourcing skill](.agents/skills/lead-sourcing/SKILL.md) and [workflow rules](.agents/skills/lead-sourcing/references/workflow-rules.md) |
| Provider selection | [Tool guide](.agents/skills/lead-sourcing/references/tools.md) |
| Tool inputs, adapters, and budgets | [Native tool and adapter contracts](.agents/skills/lead-sourcing/references/adapter-io.md) |
| JSON fields and workbook layout | [Output contract](.agents/skills/lead-sourcing/references/output-contract.md) |
| Model settings, isolation, and recovery | [Launcher](scripts/codex_tyche.py) and [runtime guide](docs/codex-isolated-testing.md) |
| Application integration | [Platform integration design](docs/platform-integration.md) — worker hosting and a protected provider gateway are planned, not shipped. |

Provider capabilities and prices are discovered live. Extend the existing
adapters and preserve evidence gates, budget checks, and uncertain-charge
reconciliation. The local ledger is writable by the worker; a hosted product
must enforce authoritative spending and credential access in its backend.

### Verify changes

Run the local test suites from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/tests -p 'test_*.py'
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'
```

Validate a saved run with:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/validate_run.py reports/<run-id>/results.json
```

Use the full validator for delivery; `--check-stop` alone can return a successful
exit while research still needs to continue. For exporter dependencies, manual
export, and receipt reconciliation, see the [runtime guide](docs/codex-isolated-testing.md).
