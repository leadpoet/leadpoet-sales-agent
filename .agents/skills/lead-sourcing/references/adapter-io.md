# Shared adapter I/O

Use the native tools for normal sourcing. The later CLI sections are diagnostics
for specific tool failures and compatibility with runtimes without native tools.
This is the shared credential, response-file, and recovery contract;
provider-specific inputs and statuses live in [Deepline](deepline-adapter.md)
and [ScrapingDog](scrapingdog-adapter.md). Examples beginning with `.agents/`
run from the repository root.

## Native tools

The launcher binds these tools to the assigned `results.json`; callers supply
research choices, not paths, route IDs or accounting envelopes.

| Tool | Agent input | Code handles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tyche_start` | Interpreted `request`, authorized `max_usd` if supplied | Original clock, files, defaults, ledger, combined cost cutoff; safe resume |
| `tyche_claim` | Website-domain `target`, optional verified LinkedIn `company_url` | Exclusive company ownership and known-alias deduplication across workers; returns the domain target or an ownership conflict |
| `tyche_lookup` | `checks` (1–3): `target`, `phase`, `purpose`, `tool`, `inputs` | Cached live description, schema checks, observed-cost checks, dispatch, receipts |
| `tyche_review` | Changed findings/source reviews and optional `web`, or the current evidence packet's `review_ref` alone | Company updates, authoritative LinkedIn/email fields, bookkeeping, confirmed JSON |
| `tyche_inspect` | No arguments, or `target`, `ref`, `field`, `tool`, `query`, `recover` | Compact state, saved request or detail, catalog search, local receipt recovery; `field="taxonomy"` lists canonical industries and `field="taxonomy.<industry>"` lists their subindustries |
| `tyche_finish` | No arguments for review; then `review_ref` and research `commentary` | Mechanical preflight, claims beside saved source excerpts, strict export/readback/preview and cost summary |

At start, supply the LLM-selected `contact_role_groups` without repeating
`requested_roles`; code saves their combined list. A request without groups still
needs `requested_roles`. Explicit conflicting lists remain errors.
Save each requested signal's `importance` (`required` or `preferred`) and any
supplied `product_service` with its `description` and `perspective` (`seller`
or `target`). These are the LLM's interpretation of the current request.
The launcher binds the original request file and saves its text once as
`request.original_text`. Compare it with the interpretation before paid research.
For a dollar budget, supply only `max_usd`; code derives provider credits. New
native runs reject aggregate `deepline_credits` and `scrapingdog_credits` inside
`request.budget`. Only for an
explicit user credit limit, use `provider_credit_limits: {"deepline": 10}`;
`{"scrapingdog": 0}` disables that provider. Saved requests and ledgers retain
their original limits on resume.
Each requested `company_types`, `industries` and `geographies` filter needs a passing
required check. Put additional must-haves in `icp.required_attributes`; do not repeat
filters there. Alternatives within one filter share one judgment; preserve the
original geographic scope. All must-haves need evidence before contact work.

New runs check required company/profile/email tools through free catalog reads
before initializing research.
The saved descriptions are reused by lookups. If a required tool is unavailable, report the prerequisite to the monitor and
stop this invocation. More company searches or finalization retries cannot fix
it. A retry refreshes failed free catalog reads while preserving the clock.

`target` is the canonical company domain or `discovery`. Phases are
`account_discovery`, `account_verification`, `contact_discovery`,
`contact_verification`, and `email_validation`. `provider` defaults to Deepline.
For recognized email finders and validators, omit `phase`; code derives it from
the selected operation without changing providers or spending eligibility.
For any provider tool used to find a reviewed buyer's email, supply `contact_ref`;
this also identifies email work for domain/person searches. Code verifies the
saved identity and supplies compatible native identity inputs before spending.
For ScrapingDog, pass `provider: "scrapingdog"` and its wrapper input in `inputs`.
`approach` may name a stable strategy. New runs use reported charges, so omit
`max_cost_credits`. ScrapingDog needs its plan conversion at start. Code never chooses
a different provider, recipient, criterion or qualification judgment.

Lookup returns a route and result references such as `lookup-abc:0`. Inspect a
route to see its response status/results, or select a result and `field` for
more detail. Page a saved route with `offset`/`limit` and its returned `next_offset`;
long text also returns `next_offset`. `tyche_inspect(tool=...)` returns cached
native inputs, constraints/pricing and output field names. Long help and enum
lists have explicit detail paths; select those with `field` and page with
`offset`/`limit`. Code validates against the complete saved contract. Learn a
selected tool once and reuse its description. Catalog searches show usable tool
summaries first; explicitly non-callable entries stay in the saved receipt. Use
short provider or capability terms when a search has no callable matches.
Use `field` for a specific nested
tool, company or run field; `refresh: true` is only for a confirmed schema,
pricing or access change. Retained receipts and execution contracts remain complete.

Company decisions: `hold_account` (research missing fit), `qualify_account`
(ready for contacts), `hold_contact`, `reject` (supported mismatch), `accept`.
Example review inputs, with references selected from actual results:

```json
{"companies":[{"target":"example.com","decision":"hold_account",
  "reason":"Current funding stage still needs evidence",
  "company":{"ref":"lookup-company:0","industry":"<verified taxonomy parent>","sub_industry":"<verified taxonomy child>"},
  "account_fit":{"ref":"lookup-source:0","fit_claim":"<supported match to the requested business activity>"}}],
 "sources":[{"ref":"lookup-source","state":"exhausted","reason":"Reviewed the complete product page"}]}
```

Progress's `review_due` and finalization's `pending_sources` come from the same
open saved lookups, including discovery. Use `tyche_inspect(field="pending_sources")`
with `offset`/`limit` to page them. Review the existing receipts; do not repeat a
lookup just to record a decision. Closed aliases do not create review reminders.
Use `sources: [{"refs": [...], "state": "exhausted", "reason": "..."}]` when
several saved lookups share one actual review decision. Unselected sources stay
open. A selected single-result opened page closes with its evidence review;
search results and pagination still require an explicit decision.
Reuse a returned final review packet until findings change. Repeated finish
calls return `unchanged: true` with the same `review_ref`, without duplicating
the packet or approving it. A resumed tool session can return the full packet.

Evidence refs expand into saved source/URL/date/text. Usually use `{"ref":"..."}`
and put the qualification judgment in its `claim`, without copying source fields
again. Inspect `requirements` and select an `attribute:N`, `icp:<field>` or `signal:N` as a check's
`requirement_ref`. Code supplies its label and importance; no separate registry
or semantic matching service is used. For a new check, omit `criterion`, `signal`
and `importance`. Put multiple supporting sources
in that check's evidence array. Unknown kinds or conflicting importance are
input errors, not new requirements. Aviato funding refs retain the supplied announcement date and round name;
they do not decide which funding stage is current. For a requested company attribute,
a funding ref can use its verified, company-bound receipt without a public URL.
Keep the captured date/text unchanged and explain the stage judgment in `claim`.
Signals still require a source URL. Compatible `sources` decisions
for different results in one lookup are combined into its existing route review;
conflicting states require one explicit decision for that lookup.
Supply reviewed `text`, `date` and `date_basis` only when interpreting an event, distinguishing announcement
from completion. Store signals in `qualification_checks` using `criterion`,
`importance`, `status`, `claim`, `signal`, and `evidence`. Use `signal` only for
requested intent. Code derives the legacy primary `signal_evidence` field.
For additional ICP-relevant facts, use optional `supporting_findings`:
`[{kind: "signal"|"context", label, claim, evidence: [{ref, event_date?}]}]`.
Omit evidence text to reuse the captured passage or structured record; supplied
excerpts must occur in that capture. Put interpretation in `claim`.
These share the captured-evidence contract and appear in Signals and Sources;
they never satisfy or change original qualification requirements. Use context for
business background, and preserve timing/status for actual activity. Do not duplicate
a requested signal here. Supplying the array replaces it; omit it to preserve saved findings.
A replacement check without `signal` removes the old label; do not copy signal
facts into a second field. The workbook and final review use these same checks.
Contact-stage and delivery checks compare reviewed signal dates with the saved
request's time windows. Historical evidence can remain on an unresolved account;
it cannot be promoted as a current signal. Errors after a web observation was
saved return its reusable reference; correct the judgment without rewriting the observation.
A company review reuses an unambiguous saved Harvest getter with the exact target domain. Identical repeated getters reuse one selection; conflicting identities or field values require an explicit company `ref`. Existing selections remain unchanged. A requested size must be supported by its receipt before contact work.
Company/profile `ref` values must select the matched Harvest getter. Add industry,
subindustry and the two-sentence description as reviewed facts. For contacts,
supply requested role and role match; code derives the saved role group.
For email lookup, pass `contact_ref` with the selected profile reference and
omit routine name, company domain and LinkedIn inputs; code fills the native
fields from the verified receipt. Supply an exact email when validating it.
After a miss, check the returned `email_search_domain`. A company website may
use a short link or subdomain rather than its work-email domain. If unsuitable,
choose a profile-based finder or a work email observed in company sources, then
validate it; do not repeat domain-based calls with the same unsuitable input.
A later `primary_contact: {"email_ref":"lookup-validation:0"}` supplies the exact
address and verdict from the selected validation result. An existing different
email is a conflict; explicitly select the new email to replace it. Changing
people requires a new profile ref; changing email clears the old email evidence.
Selecting an eligible BounceBan result automatically retains its original
ZeroBounce receipt and links the fallback. Backup entries are full selections.

For built-in web tools, execute the chosen search/read, then send its observed
`status` and `results` with `target`, `purpose`, `query` and `operation` under
`web` in the review call. Use `web:<observation index>:<result index>` across the
entire call: the first page of the second observation is `web:1:0`, even for a
different company. Use `web:1` for that whole observation in `sources`.
Reuse shared saved sources by their returned lookup reference. The tool records this observation;
it cannot invoke or independently capture Codex's built-in browser. Replaying
the same observation reuses its receipt. A new observation of the same URL with different text gets a distinct receipt; the earlier receipt stays unchanged.

`recover` never redispatches: it finishes recording a saved normalized receipt.
An outcome marked `recorded: true` is already saved; repeated recovery cannot
settle unknown billing. At finish, code matches billing by saved request ID,
provider and catalog-backed operation aliases. It accepts posted charges and
explicit free outcomes; missing billing is never zero. A returned result billed
as a miss/zero units is recorded as observed billing with an issue, while its
charge stays pending. `inspect(field="costs")` and the saved report separate
billed USD and pending call counts. Local reconciliation uses individual posted
credit-ledger debits before the usage feed's free/failed records. Grouped usage
totals are never split or counted alongside individual debits. New response
billing settles only with explicit final pricing; queued ledger posting does
not invalidate a final price. Unknown and estimated prices stay pending.

Billing reads use a 30-second timeout and at most three attempts per saved call
set, including across restarts. A failed read gets one immediate retry; pending
billing can be rechecked after 60 seconds or at final approval within that same
limit. `billing_reconciliation.py results.json --resume` explicitly permits
three more read-only attempts without resetting spend. Pagination continues
from its saved ledger cursor or usage offset when an attempt reaches its four-page-per-feed limit;
API reads first check the newest page for delayed postings. All feeds share the
same 30-second deadline. Repeated pages and invalid offsets leave unmatched
charges pending. A transport outage can fall back to the other billing feed;
malformed records and changed organizations cannot. No paid research is repeated,
and original receipts/caps are preserved.
If only a pending or raw response survived, retain the pending charge and reconcile
it locally through diagnostics. Never retry an uncertain paid call. Explicit
`sources` reviews retain the existing continuation/exhaustion rules; saving a
company does not exhaust search results or pagination. Selecting and saving a
successful single-result company getter, profile getter, email verdict or opened page closes
that individual lookup automatically. Pending jobs and multi-result lookups
retain explicit review. A `valid` email on a catch-all
domain stays valid; fallback eligibility is checked before spending.

Native email-validation results include `email_decisions`: receipt-derived
`usable`, `fallback_allowed` and the next step. `valid` with a domain catch-all
flag remains usable. Do not revalidate it with BounceBan or reject its company.
Email lookup/validation requires a previously saved matching Harvest profile and
requested-role review. Free pending-job recovery remains available.

`completion_candidates` is derived from saved qualified candidates and receipts.
Prefer completing these when affordable. A blocker allows the researcher to
choose different work; this advice neither reserves funds nor dispatches calls.

The native relay reconnects a confirmed-dead sandboxed child at most once per
invocation, with identical sandbox policy, checkout and run. Only pure saved-state
inspection is replayed automatically. After a lost lookup/review response, inspect
the saved run and recover receipts; do not resubmit uncertain paid work. A second
connection failure returns a clear operational block with its captured exit code.

Before `decision: "accept"`, finalize the company: reuse saved evidence, make
focused lookups where more ICP-relevant detail would improve the narrative within
the existing budget/deadline, and save new findings with `intent_details`. Finding
nothing new does not block acceptance. Preserve the valid description and contacts.
After `decision: "accept"`, `tyche_review` returns `review_required` with
`review_scope: "confirmed_leads"` for the newly completed or changed leads.
Follow its evidence and writing instructions immediately, then call
`tyche_review` with the current `review_ref` and `review_findings`, separately
from edits. Each finding is `{target, source_refs, finding}`: one brief factual
comparison per company, citing its saved passages and covering every included
contact, consistent Signals/Intent Details, source grounding and client-field QA.
Approval returns `confirmed_leads_saved` and atomically updates `leads.json`.
Correct unsupported findings through ordinary review first; changes require a
fresh reference. New lookups return the pending packet without dispatch until
these leads are reviewed or held. Already running lookups may finish normally.
Previously confirmed, unchanged leads do not require another incremental review.

`tyche_inspect` includes the confirmed file path, count and pending review domains.
On resume, continue from that state; an approval retry does not repeat lookups or
duplicate leads. The file starts empty and retains confirmed leads through later
research failures. It excludes incomplete, changed and withdrawn records. This
does not lower `target_count`, authorize stopping, or replace the final review
and workbook checks. See the [JSON contract](output-contract.md#leadsjson-confirmed-leads).
The diagnostic review CLI saves findings; use the native tool for evidence approval.

`tyche_finish` returns `needs_research`, `review_required`, `needs_repair` or
validated artifact paths. Mechanical errors and pending source reviews appear
before a review reference is issued. On `review_required`, compare the company's
final prose with its adjacent `sources` excerpts, then review dates, meaning
and required fit before passing `review_ref` and `review_findings`. Correct
unsupported optional facts without discarding an otherwise qualified lead;
reasonable qualified analysis needs no direct citation for every inference. Full excerpts are
available through ordinary result inspection. `inspect(target=..., field="evidence_review")`
provides the same view during account research. Changes
to research invalidate that reference. Correct named errors through `tyche_review`
and finish again. Source observations for accepted companies can still be saved
after reaching the target; corrections preserve verified contacts and emails.
The approval and company-specific findings are saved for that exact state.
Code checks coverage and source attribution, not semantic truth. If export is interrupted,
code can retry it once when the worker ends without repeating research or
approving an unreviewed snapshot. Do not repeat unchanged failing calls.

`capture_method` distinguishes adapter-saved provider responses from
`agent_recorded_web` discovery notes. Passing web qualifications require an existing
page-reader lookup (ScrapingDog `scrape` or a Deepline reader such as Firecrawl),
not a model-transcribed passage. Reuse that receipt across checks; do not fetch it
again merely to review it. Quotes must occur in the captured body. Source dates
and their basis come from captured metadata and cannot be overridden. Undated
pages stay observations; `event_date` is a separate judgment from the body,
preserving month/year precision. The final reviewer still judges meaning and
planned versus completed status against the original requirement.

The success response includes a concise cost summary; final model usage is still
refreshed by the launcher after exit. Use `inspect(field="costs")` for saved costs.

Older abbreviated signal labels are not automatically guessed or accepted.
On resume, inspect requirements and explicitly update the existing criterion
with its selected `requirement_ref`, reviewed claim, status and existing evidence.
Keep `criterion` unchanged to replace that check; omit the old `signal` label.
This preserves the request, receipts and ledger while applying current evidence
and date checks. An ambiguous or unsupported mapping remains unresolved.

## Diagnostic CLI

Use `-` to supply JSON directly on stdin, normally with a quoted heredoc as
shown below. The helper saves durable records; routine lookups and reviews
do not need temporary input files. Correct the named field in an error before
reading implementation code.

## Start or resume

The LLM interprets the ICP, signals and role priorities. Put that
[input request](output-contract.md#input-contract) under `request` in a setup
object; supply it as UTF-8 JSON on stdin with `--start-file -`:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/run_attempt.py \
  reports/<run-id>/results.json --start-file -
```

Optional setup fields are `max_usd`, `scrapingdog_usd_per_credit` and `started_at`.
`verification_reserve_credits` is retained only for historical version 1 callers.
The helper supplies defaults, the run ID, original clock, empty result records
and ledger. It validates before writing and preserves existing criteria,
evidence, pending calls and spending on an identical retry. Interrupted writes
retain the original initialization settings. A leftover lock still requires
checking that its writer has stopped; locks are never expired automatically.

Use `--status` to resume an existing run without resubmitting its request. Do
not manually construct result bookkeeping or run `budget_guard.py` afterward.
The ledger's existing initialization command remains for legacy callers.

## One attempt

Use `--lookup-file -` with one research lookup or an array of up to
three independent lookups. This composes the existing wrappers, budget guard
and recorder; it does not choose a research strategy. For free catalog search:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/run_attempt.py \
  reports/<run-id>/results.json --lookup-file - <<'JSON'
{"request": {"operation": "search", "query": "multilingual product-page research"}}
JSON
```

For a chosen provider tool, supply `scope` (canonical company domain or
`discovery`), `phase`, `purpose`, `approach` and `request`. `provider` defaults to `deepline`; `scrapingdog` and
`public_web` use their existing wrapper inputs. For example:

```json
{
  "scope": "example.com",
  "phase": "account_verification",
  "purpose": "Check the current business and funding stage",
  "approach": "current-company-profile",
  "request": {"operation": "execute", "tool": "<live-described-tool>", "payload": {}}
}
```

The tool name and empty payload above are placeholders, not dispatchable inputs.
Use a live-described tool and its native payload. Native tools and all
`run_attempt.py` lookup CLI formats check the saved same-run description for
availability and validate the full JSON Schema, including nested fields, enums
and array items, before planning or dispatching paid work. Invalid inputs return
the field path and constraint for correction; they create no paid reservation.
Embedded schema references are supported; external references are not fetched.
Field-only descriptions retain their required-field and type checks. Reuse
descriptions until schema or access changes. Unknown catalog pricing does not block new runs.
Unknown actual billing remains in the ledger and blocks replay or final delivery, but a
distinct useful route may continue while confirmed spend remains below the threshold.

Code generates route IDs, fingerprints, receipt paths, paid-call flags and
`spend` metadata. Catalog reads receive their own scope/phase automatically.
Contact phases retain the existing passing-account-evidence gate.
`review_due` returns a count and up to three company scopes with completed
research awaiting review. It is a reminder, not another qualification rule.

Use stable `approach` labels describing the source family and search/evidence
strategy, not tool names, batch numbers or cosmetic rewordings. The helper hashes
the actual request, so changing a route ID or approach label cannot repeat a
possibly billed request. Two comparable research attempts within the same scope
and phase without new verified milestones require a changed approach. Progress
at another company does not reset that company's research. Profile/email checks
for distinct targets and advancement to another phase remain eligible; finishing
one source does not exhaust the company. Catalog reads do not count as progress.

The helper saves `receipts/<action-id>.json` before updating run state. A crash
leaves the route pending and retains pending accounting. Resume a saved normalized
response with `--complete <action-id>`; this only records it, never dispatches.
New ledgers and helper receipts carry a fingerprint of the canonical results
path. Resume in place: rewriting paths in a copied ledger or receipt does not
make it belong to another run. Missing or mismatched identities require origin
and billing reconciliation; never erase them, reset spend, or rerun uncertain calls.
Historical ledgers without this marker remain available to the validator's
read-only `--legacy-stop-policy`; that mode cannot authorize execution or delivery.
It derives summary/review counts and cost totals from saved outcomes and receipts;
unknown charges keep provider capacity unknown. Attempt recording never marks
the frontier complete; the export command prepares completion after review.
Each saved response also retains the action and redacted input in `attempt`,
so recovering a damaged draft does not require inventing scope or approach labels.
If only raw response bytes survived, normalize that receipt locally first. A
pending/unknown remote outcome is not permission to retry. Async research jobs
need their documented result-retrieval call, not another job submission.
For a described **free job-status getter only**, mark its action
`status_read: true` with a zero cost bound. Repeated reads of the same job are
allowed only after a saved `partial` status response with a zero cost bound;
pending transport, failures and job submissions remain protected. Respect the
provider's polling interval and applicable read limit; never label submission
or enrichment as a status read. These calls still use the guarded ledger;
missing actual charges remain unknown, even when a catalog quote is zero.
During finalization, an email-verification getter additionally requires a
catalog-confirmed zero price and the original pending submission in this run.
The runtime links the getter to that submission without changing its receipt,
spending threshold or research deadline. Unused pending addresses stay in the audit;
every exported address still requires its own completed verification receipt.

For built-in public-web tools, plan a single discovery pilot as an object:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/run_attempt.py \
  reports/<run-id>/results.json --lookup-file - --plan-only <<'JSON'
{"provider":"public_web","scope":"discovery","phase":"account_discovery",
 "purpose":"Find announcements matching requested signals","approach":"official-announcements",
 "request":{"operation":"search_query","query":"<query derived from the current ICP>"}}
JSON
```

Code supplies zero cost/calls and the route ID. Execute the planned search/read
through the available web tool. Include its observed response in the route's
`response` when [saving your review](#save-a-review), together with company
findings. Supply observed status/results only; receipt metadata comes from code.
`operation` is optional but must match the plan; `error` may describe a failure.
Never label a failure `no_results` or a pending outcome complete. Saving a review
does not invoke a browser or provider.

The helper never infers qualification or market exhaustion. Assess the saved
evidence and submit company/route decisions together with `--review-file` below.
Full strict validation remains required before delivery.

The review helper fills missing email verdicts from saved same-run provider
responses and rejects conflicts. A valid verdict remains valid when the domain
has a catch-all flag. Before a BounceBan verification, the attempt helper checks
the saved same-email ZeroBounce result and refuses ineligible or repeated calls.
Recover pending jobs with the documented free status getter; never resubmit them.

The attempt CLI prints normalized provider results once, with the full receipt
path. Harvest rows show company/contact facts, current-role candidates, discovered
emails and missing fields; `omitted_fields` identifies additional saved data.
For Harvest profile getters, the helper supplies the reviewed company's LinkedIn
URL as local `target_company_linkedin_url` metadata to select its current role.
It is not sent to the provider. Multiple matching roles require review; a headline
or a historical role without an end date does not establish the current title.
Finder email flags never replace ZeroBounce or eligible BounceBan validation.
Repeated progress snapshots, request metadata and duplicate evidence stay in
the receipt. Reopen it with `run_attempt.py <results.json> --receipt <route-id>`
to reuse this compact view without dispatching or changing state. The view checks
run ownership and the saved route's request/provider identity, including pending
receipts; mismatches require origin reconciliation. Inspect specific
raw fields only for a missing fact or contradiction; full receipts remain saved.

## Save a review

Save each company decision when made, including supported rejections and
unresolved gaps. Refine the record as new facts arrive. A `companies` item
identifies `scope` and only the fields being updated. One call can also save
the observed web response and close its reviewed route:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/run_attempt.py \
  reports/<run-id>/results.json --review-file - <<'JSON'
{
  "companies": [{
    "scope": "example.com",
    "state": "unresolved",
    "company": {"canonical_name": "Example"},
    "reason_text": "The business fits; the announcement date remains unknown.",
    "qualification_checks": [{
      "criterion": "recent_intent", "importance": "required", "status": "unknown",
      "claim": "The announcement has no verified date yet.", "evidence": []
    }]
  }],
  "routes": [{"route_id": "<returned-route-id>",
    "response": {"status":"ok","results":[{"url":"https://example.com/news","text":"Observed announcement text without a date."}]},
    "reason": "Reviewed the announcement; its date is not established."}]
}
JSON
```

`company` updates the supplied factual fields. `qualification_checks` updates
one judgment per `criterion` name, ignoring capitalization and extra whitespace.
Supply importance, status, claim and the selected current evidence explicitly;
that evidence replaces the previous selection. Omitted `signal` metadata and
unrelated checks remain unchanged, and original provider receipts stay saved.
Duplicate criterion updates or multiple saved matches require reconciliation;
code does not decide which judgment is correct or whether the company fits.

`account_fit`, `signal_evidence`, `supporting_findings`, `intent_details`, `primary_contact` and
`backup_contacts` are complete replacements when supplied, and untouched when
omitted. Review new contacts and source identities before replacing them.
State defaults to the saved state (new companies start unresolved); set
`state: "accepted"` or `"rejected"` explicitly. Acceptance retains all existing
evidence/contact gates; a missing fact cannot become a rejection without an
evidenced required mismatch. Set `stage: "contact"` after account review passes,
with remaining buyer gaps in `reason_text`.

`response` is optional and only for observed public-web results; provider
responses are already saved by their lookup. All attached responses are checked
before any are written. Responses persist before the company/route review:
if that review fails or is interrupted, correct and resubmit the same review.
Already saved responses stay immutable; never repeat research or a paid call
to repair a save. `companies`, `routes` and `next_actions` are optional;
omitted records remain intact. Execute your next choice with `--lookup-file -`;
supply `next_actions` only for concrete work that needs saving.

One atomic update saves the selected company rows, closes reviewed routes,
retires their completed actions, removes speculative follow-ups for reviewed
parked/terminal companies, and refreshes counts and cost summaries. Receipts,
ledger charges and the saved request remain intact. The CLI response includes
`request_file` and the next decision, without repeating the full request.
No separate route-closing script, manual summary edits or duplicate stop check
is needed. Use the returned next decision for the next batch; reopen receipts
only for a missing fact or contradiction. `--status` includes the authoritative request for setup/resume,
without a write.

Routes default to `exhausted`; the helper derives the existing exhaustion basis
from the saved receipt. Use `state: "continuable"` for genuinely unfinished
work, or `"blocked"` for an evidenced provider failure. Existing continuation
links are preserved; supply `continuation_route_ids` only to add actual links.
Never close a pending/unknown response. The helper refuses missing receipts,
failed calls presented as exhausted, or decisions contradicting the saved
employee range. It does not infer source credibility or qualify companies for
you. Full strict output validation still checks delivery.

### Compatibility and recovery

File paths remain supported instead of `-`. Existing `--input-file`
action/request envelopes, `--batch-files` and complete `{state, row}` reviews
remain available for older callers. Use the concise forms above for new work.
`--complete <route-id>` recovers an already saved response without dispatch;
`--complete <route-id> --response-file -` can attach an observed web response
alone. Neither recovery path can replace an existing response or change its
run identity.

## Concurrent company checks

After the pilot, use one agent and up to three ready checks for different
companies. Use fewer when fewer checks are ready or the remaining lead shortfall
is smaller. Batch ready checks instead of calling them one by one; different
companies may be at different phases. Do not wait to fill a batch.
Supply the same concise lookup objects above as an array on stdin:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/run_attempt.py \
  reports/<run-id>/results.json --lookup-file -
```

All paths use the same execution, independence and budget checks.
The helper validates every input with the existing provider
validators before planning or spending. Malformed fields identify their batch item
and stop the entire batch without changing run state.

Give each lookup its canonical company domain as `scope`; code assigns IDs.
Batch mode accepts account verification, contact discovery, contact verification
and email validation. Free catalog lookups may share discovery scope in a batch.
Keep substantive discovery pilots on the single-attempt path. Choose
only independent work: a company's buyer lookup waits for saved passing account
evidence, and email validation waits for its buyer/address checks. Deduplicate
aliases and owner groups before choosing the batch; do not run redundant provider
requests for the same company at once.

The helper plans serially, runs up to three provider calls concurrently, and
records results serially. Each call has its own receipt. Dispatch identities and
settlements share the existing ledger and are serialized. New runs check confirmed
spending before dispatch; already running calls can finish above the threshold.
Completed calls without billing remain unknown without blocking a distinct route. After input validation,
a member refused by eligibility/budget checks or a failed provider call
does not discard successful siblings. The batch returns all outcomes and exits
nonzero if any member fails; recover saved receipts with `--complete`, never
rerun the whole batch or retry an uncertain billed request.
Single attempts follow the same exit-code rule: `ok`, `partial`, and `no_results`
are successful provider outcomes; provider failures return nonzero even when
the adapter successfully returned JSON. Adapter errors remain nonzero. Saved
receipts, pending charges and successful batch members are preserved. A successful
attempt still requires evidence review and full delivery validation.
The batch returns one final `stop_decision` after recording its outcomes; use
that decision without a separate status or stop-check command.

For built-in public-web checks, add `--plan-only` to prepare up to three receipts,
then execute those independent searches/reads together through the available
tool's parallel-call facility. Python only plans and records this work; it does
not invoke the built-in browser. Include observed responses in one `--review-file -`
call with company findings and source reviews. Separate response files are only
needed for targeted diagnostic recovery.

Wait for the batch to finish, then save its decisions with `--review-file` and
use the returned next step. Batch completion alone does not qualify leads.
Use one check when only one is ready or a provider requires serial access; a
rate limit is a reason to reduce concurrency, never to increase retries.

## Paid-call budget

New runs use the [actual-cost policy](provider-pricing.md). `max_usd` defaults
to $0.80 per requested lead and covers reported provider charges plus the local
launcher's estimated base LLM usage. The ledger records each request identity
before dispatch. ScrapingDog records its documented tariff ceiling as an audit hold;
all providers use the confirmed actual-cost cutoff. After the confirmed total reaches the
threshold, new paid work stops. Already running calls may overshoot it.

Do not supply `max_cost_credits` or an email-verification reserve. Missing
billing stays pending, prevents replay and blocks final delivery until reconciled;
it does not block a distinct route under the confirmed-cost threshold. Catalog prices
help select tools, but do not become reported charges. Explicit zero provider
allocations still disable a provider. ScrapingDog requires the saved plan's USD
conversion. Optional provider and next-lead thresholds use observed spend.

The native helpers preserve the original request, limits, receipts and unique
call IDs across restarts. Never reset the ledger or redispatch an uncertain
call. Version 1 ledgers preserve their historical reservation rules; they are
not migrated when resumed. A lock conflict still fails without sending. Inspect
an interrupted writer before removing any stale lock.

All Deepline execute rows are saved; lookup/inspect paginates their display.
Display limits do not limit provider billing. For legacy version 1 ledgers, a
reservation override can increase a supported whole-call bound but cannot
establish an unknown price. Never expire a lock automatically: inspect the
ledger and receipts and confirm no writer remains before removing a stale lock.

## Response files

Both adapters accept `--output-file <new-path>`. Use a distinct path per route
in the run's receipt directory. The parent directory must already exist.
The adapter checks the destination before dispatch and refuses existing files.
It atomically saves the full redacted provider body before normalization, then
adds the normalized result. Stdout remains the existing single JSON response.
The saved `provider_response` includes Deepline exit code/body/stderr or
ScrapingDog HTTP status/body; candidate output limits do not truncate this copy.
Existing transport size and timeout bounds still apply.
Non-finite or malformed JSON is retained as redacted diagnostic text, never
promoted to results. Non-finite input is rejected before dispatch. Available
partial Deepline stdout/stderr is also retained after a timeout; it is not a
successful provider result and must not promote an email or trigger a retry.
Interrupted ScrapingDog responses retain available bytes with `incomplete: true`;
neither broken chunks nor a short declared body is a successful empty result.
JSON output escapes non-ASCII text so receipts and stdout also work with narrow
terminal encodings. Invalid UTF-8 CLI bytes are preserved as escaped diagnostic
text and yield a response error, not candidates.

`receipt_status` is `pending`, `response_received`, or `complete`; these describe
file processing, not provider success or billing. A local input failure has
`error_stage: request`; an unrecognized response has `error_stage: response`.
An explicit remote schema error may have `error_stage: provider`. Do not assume
every schema error means the request payload was wrong. Native lookup checks
the saved contract and cost before dispatch. Use its exact field errors to
correct inputs; inspect only the missing constraint. Refresh a descriptor when
there is evidence it changed. The adapter does not implement every provider's
schema, so provider-specific response errors may still need investigation.

A failed final save returns a nonzero exit code and `receipt_error` while
preserving the normalized stdout and any previously saved raw response. Check
those artifacts and billing before recovery; never rerun a possibly paid call
merely to recreate a file. File output does not spend credits or retry providers.

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/deepline.py \
  --input '{"operation":"search","query":"small textile wholesalers"}' \
  --output-file 'reports/<run-id>/receipts/catalog-1.json'
```

## Credentials and artifacts

Use the environment or connected credential store. Record only availability,
never a value:

- `DEEPLINE_API_KEY` and optional `DEEPLINE_HOST_URL`.
- `DEEPLINE_BIN` (optional path to the Deepline CLI binary).
- `SCRAPINGDOG_API_KEY`.

For each run, deliver `reports/<run-id>/report.md`,
`reports/<run-id>/results.json`, and `reports/<run-id>/leads.xlsx`. Include the
request, hypotheses, route commands and filters, pilot observations, statuses,
route cost bases, confirmed and maximum credits, Deepline dollar cost and cost
per accepted lead, accepted evidence, contact selection, and rejected or
unresolved rows with stable reasons. Keep provider receipts separate from output state. Never
infer evidence from memory or present an unverified company or contact as final.
