# ScrapingDog adapter

Before the first ScrapingDog execution, read [shared I/O](adapter-io.md),
[request bounds](#request-envelope-and-bounds),
[normalization](#normalized-output-and-conservative-parsing), and the
[status contract](#scrapingdog-wrapper-status-contract). Read only the chosen
operation's row and example in the core or conditional operation table;
the other operations are not prerequisites. Revisit shared failure handling
only when relevant. These are local adapter contracts, not the vendor's whole API.

## ScrapingDog wrapper

`scripts/scrapingdog.py` is the only supported local ScrapingDog adapter here.
It makes one bounded GET request, redacts secrets, and returns normalized rows.
Its current supported canonical operation set is 25 operations. Aliases are
accepted for compatibility, but use canonical names in new requests and
receipts. Do not call an endpoint directly from this skill.

### Request envelope and bounds

- The request key is `operation` or the compatibility key `op`. The value is
  case-insensitive and must be a canonical operation or an alias listed below.
- The API key is read only from `SCRAPINGDOG_API_KEY`. `api_key` in the JSON
  request and a `base_url` override are rejected.
- `limit` is optional, defaults to `10`, and is capped at `20`. It caps returned
  normalized rows and bounds provider `results` or `num` where those inputs
  exist. Single-object operations still accept this common control.
- `timeout_seconds` is optional, defaults to `30`, and is capped at `60`.
- The tables list operation-specific keys. Every operation also accepts the
  common `limit` and `timeout_seconds` keys. An omitted optional key is not sent
  to the provider, except where the adapter always sends a bounded `results` or
  `num` value as noted.

| Canonical operation (aliases) | Exact endpoint | Required request keys | Optional forwarded keys | Documented credits and conservative output note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `google_search` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/google` | `query` or compatibility `q` | `results`, `page`, `country`, `language`, `domain`, `advance_search`, `mob_search` | 5 standard; 10 with advanced or mobile search. Search URLs need exact-page verification. |
| `universal_search` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/search` | `query` or `q` | `country`, `language` | 20. A search result is not evidence until its source is verified. |
| `scrape` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/scrape` | `url` or compatibility `target_url` (HTTP(S)) | `dynamic`, `premium`, `wait`, `country` | 1 with `dynamic=false`; 5 by default (JS enabled), 10 for premium without JS, 25 for JS + premium, and 10 for country without JS/premium. Country combined with JS/premium has no verified combined tariff. Returns bounded normalized evidence, not a full raw payload. |
| `linkedin_company` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/profile` (`type=company`, `id`) | `id` or `company_id`, or `url`/`company_url` with a LinkedIn company URL | none | 10 per company request according to the endpoint reference. Profile facts can support identity or fit, not a buying signal. |
| `linkedin_person` (`linkedin_profile`, `linkedin_person_profile`) | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/profile` (`type=profile`, `id`) | `id`, `profile_id`, or `public_identifier`, or `url`, `profile_url`, `person_url`, or `linkedin_url` with a LinkedIn person URL | `premium`, `webhook` | 50–100 depending on protected status; hold 100 until attributable billing distinguishes it. This is exact-profile current-role verification, not broad contact discovery. A `webhook=202` response is unsupported polling and remains unresolved. |
| `linkedin_job` (`linkedin_job_details`, `linkedin_job_overview`) | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/jobs` (`job_id`) | `job_id` or `id`, or `url`, `job_url`, `job_link`, or `linkedin_url` with a LinkedIn job URL | none | 5. One exact job detail; normalizes hiring URL/text/date when present. |
| `google_jobs` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/google_jobs` | `query` or `q` | `country`, `language`, `uule`, `domain`, `next_page_token`, `chips`, `lrad`, `ltype`, `uds` | 5. Normalized job/company/link/date fields may be null; relative provider dates stay as returned. |
| `linkedin_jobs` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/jobs` (`field`) | `field`, or compatibility `query`/`q` (copied to `field`) | `geoid`, `location`, `page`, `sort_by`, `job_type`, `exp_level`, `work_type`, `filter_by_company` | 5. One bounded page; only recognized response shapes become rows. |
| `google_maps` (`google_maps_search`, `google_maps_lookup`) | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/google_maps` | `query` or `q` | `ll`, `domain`, `language`, `country`, `data`, `place_id`, `type`, `page`; `page` requires `ll` | 5. Place IDs and listing facts are metadata, not proof without source verification. |
| `google_maps_place` (`google_place`, `google_places`, `google_maps_places`) | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/google_maps/places` | one of `data_id`, `place_id`, `ludocid` | `country` | 5. One place detail; a place ID is not a fabricated source URL. |
| `google_local` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/google_local` | `query` or `q` | `location`, `uule`, `country`, `language`, `domain`, `ludocid`, `tbs`, `page` | 5. Local listing fields are candidates and need identity/source verification. |

```

The wrapper reads only `SCRAPINGDOG_API_KEY` from the environment. Never put a
key in JSON, shell history, or an artifact. Paid calls are one-call pilots with
no automatic retry. `scrapingdog_billing.py` records the versioned published
endpoint tariff and forwarded price options with each receipt. Completed HTTP
200 requests settle that rate, including empty results and normalization errors.
An explicit provider failure settles at zero under the published failed-request
policy. A local timeout is not proof that the provider failed.

Documented ranges (person profiles 50–100; LinkedIn posts 5 in the endpoint
reference versus 25 on the pricing page), queued responses and lost responses
retain the full documented ceiling as a separate budget hold. They do not become
confirmed charges and are never replayed automatically. Those holds count toward
both dollar and credit limits, including concurrent dispatch and restart. The
run can continue while there is budget for a different request. Unknown option
combinations without a verified ceiling still require billing evidence.

ScrapingDog remains disabled by default and requires the saved plan's USD-per-credit
conversion when enabled. Historical ledgers keep their original reservation limits;
new dispatches cannot reserve less than the documented tariff. No old benchmark
receipt is repriced automatically. The [Account API](https://www.scrapingdog.com/documentation/account-api/)
exposes account-wide usage, which is not attributed to individual concurrent calls.
The [pricing page](https://www.scrapingdog.com/pricing/) and linked endpoint
references are the tariff sources, checked September 19, 2026.

When a response includes a provider page token, the wrapper returns it as
`continuation_cursor`. It searches the top level and nested `pagination`,
`scrapingdog_pagination`, `data`, `result`, or `response` objects. Pass a cursor
as `next_page_token` only after current rows justify another explicitly budgeted
paid call; this is expansion, not retry.

### Implemented conditional operations

These operations are implemented by the local adapter and use the same response
shape, evidence, budget, and no-retry rules as the core routes.

| Canonical operation (aliases) | Exact endpoint | Required request keys | Optional forwarded keys and constraints | Documented credits and conservative output note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `google_ai_mode` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/google/ai_mode` | `query` or `q` | `country`, `language`, `uule`, `location`, `safe`, `html`; `uule` and `location` cannot both be set | 10. Normalizes answer/text blocks and references into common evidence fields when recognized; text without a source URL is not accepted account evidence. |
| `google_news` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/google_news` | `query` or `q` | `results`, `country`, `page`, `domain`, `language`, `lr`, `uule`, `tbs`, `safe`, `nfpr`, `html`; `results` is always bounded by `limit` | 5. Normalizes headline/snippet/link/date fields; relative provider dates stay as returned. |
| `linkedin_post` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/profile/post` (`id`) | `id` or `post_id` | none | 5. The public post schema is not fixed. Only recognized content/identity shapes become rows; unknown successful shapes are `schema_error`. |
| `x_profile` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/x/profile` (`profileId`) | `profileId`, `profile_id`, or `id` | none | 5. Normalizes profile text and source URL when present; it does not establish a company or current contact role by itself. |
| `x_post` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/x/post` (`tweetId`) | `tweetId`, `tweet_id`, or `id` | none | 5. Normalizes post text and source URL when present; post identity is not company identity without corroboration. |
| `youtube_search` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/youtube/search` | `search_query` | `country`, `language`, `sp` (filters or provider next-page token) | 5. Combines recognized `channel_results`, `video_results`, `shorts_results`, and `movie_results` arrays before applying `limit`; common title/link/date/text fields may be null. |
| `youtube_video` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/youtube/video` | `v` or `video_id`, or a supported YouTube `url` | `country`, `language` | 5. Normalizes video title/description/link and selected metadata; a video is not a company signal without dated, company-linked evidence. |
| `youtube_transcript` (`youtube_transcripts`) | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/youtube/transcripts` | `v` or `video_id`, or a supported YouTube `url` | `country`, `language` | 1. Normalizes transcript text from a recognized transcript shape; text alone may lack a date or company URL. |
| `google_ads_transparency` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/google/ads_transparency` | at least one of `advertiser_id` or `text` | `platform` only `PLAY`, `MAPS`, `SEARCH`, `SHOPPING`, `YOUTUBE`; `political_ads`, `region`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `creative_format`, `next_page_token`, `html`, `num`; truthy `political_ads` requires `region`; `num` is always sent bounded by `limit` | 5. Reads the official `ad_creatives` envelope; converts `last_shown` or `first_shown` Unix time to an ISO UTC date and retains the creative ID and format. |
| `google_patents` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/google_patents` | `query` or `q` | `num`, `page`, `sort`, `clustered`, `dups`, `patents`, `scholar`, `before`, `after`, `inventor`, `assignee`, `country`, `language`, `status`, `type`, `litigation`; `num` is always sent bounded by `limit` | 5. Normalizes patent title, abstract, assignee, identifier, URL, and date when present; a patent result is not a buying signal without current company-linked evidence. |
| `google_patent_details` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/google_patents/details` | `patent_id` | `language`, `html` | 5. One exact patent detail; unknown or empty detail envelopes remain `no_results` or `schema_error`, not inferred facts. |
| `tiktok_profile` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/tiktok/profile` | `username` | none | 5. Normalizes profile text and URL when present; profile data does not prove a company buying signal. |
| `tiktok_post` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/tiktok/post` | `url`, or both `username` and `post_id` | none | 5. A URL request sends only `url`; the ID form sends `username` and `post_id`. Normalizes post text and URL, and converts a Unix `created_at` value to an ISO UTC date. |
| `tiktok_ads` | `GET https://api.scrapingdog.com/tiktok/ads` | at least one of `query` or `advertiser_id` | `query_type` only `1` or `2`, `country`, `time_period`, `sort_by`, `next_page_token`; type 1 requires `query`, type 2 requires `advertiser_id`; advertiser-only input defaults to type 2 | 5. Normalizes the official ad name, first/last shown dates, ID, type, audience/spend/impression metadata, and first supplied video or image URL. Empty ad envelopes are `no_results`. |

```

The accepted operation aliases are: `linkedin_profile` and
`linkedin_person_profile` → `linkedin_person`; `linkedin_job_details` and
`linkedin_job_overview` → `linkedin_job`; `google_maps_search` and
`google_maps_lookup` → `google_maps`; `google_place`, `google_places`, and
`google_maps_places` → `google_maps_place`; and `youtube_transcripts` →
`youtube_transcript`. The output `operation` echoes the normalized request key;
use canonical names in new receipts.

`instagram_*` operations are not in the adapter's operation set and are
rejected. The dedicated Instagram contract is incomplete, so do not call an
Instagram endpoint directly or claim Instagram support. If no supported
operation or live Deepline capability exists for a route, record
`route_not_connected` as unresolved. Use search-index results to discover URLs
only; scrape the exact source page before using its text as evidence. A public
profile can support identity/current role only when it names the person, role,
and company; it does not prove a buying signal by itself. A CEO is not an
automatic contact fallback.

### Normalized output and conservative parsing

Every successful row contains these normalized keys, which may be `null`:
`company`, `domain`, `signal`, `evidence_url`, `evidence_date`,
`evidence_text`, `provider`, `operation`, and `provider_metadata`. The wrapper
does not promise provider fields that it does not normalize. The allowlisted
metadata keys are `rank`, `job_id`, `linkedin_id`, `profile_id`, `profileId`,
`tweet_id`, `video_id`, `patent_id`, `advertiser_id`, `ad_id`, `ad_format`,
`first_shown`, `last_shown`, `estimated_audience`, `spend`, `impressions`,
`username`, `post_id`,
`company_url`, `place_id`, `data_id`, `ludocid`, `title`, `location`, `industry`,
`company_size`, `address`, `phone`, `rating`, `reviews`, and
`gps_coordinates`, when supplied by the provider. `linkedin_person` can also
normalize `contact`, `contact_name`, `full_name`, `contact_url`,
`contact_title`, `current_title`, and `contact_email`; this remains role
verification, not contact discovery. Missing fields are not inferred.

For YouTube search, recognized `channel_results`, `video_results`,
`shorts_results`, and `movie_results` arrays are combined before `limit` is
applied. A recognized response may expose `continuation_cursor` from
`next_page_token`, `nextPageToken`, or `next_token` at the top level or inside
`pagination`, `scrapingdog_pagination`, `data`, `result`, or `response`. Use a
cursor only for a new, explicitly budgeted paid call after inspecting current
rows; this is expansion, not retry.

### ScrapingDog wrapper status contract

The wrapper emits the same status set as the Deepline adapter: `ok`,
`no_results`, `partial`, `rate_limited`, `auth_failed`, `quota_exceeded`,
`timeout`, `schema_error`, `provider_error`, and `config_error`. `ok` means
recognized normalized rows were returned; `no_results` means a valid response had none;
`partial` means the provider marked the response partial. HTTP 429 maps to
`rate_limited`, and 401/403 maps to `auth_failed`. Explicit quota or credit text
maps to `quota_exceeded`. An unexplained HTTP 402 stays `provider_error` because
the public ScrapingDog error documentation does not list it. Invalid input and
malformed or unknown successful response
shapes are `schema_error`; missing credentials are `config_error`; HTTP 202 is
an unresolved `provider_error` because this adapter does not poll queued work.
Other transport or HTTP failures, including HTTP 410, are also
`provider_error`. Only `ok` and `partial` may supply candidates; `no_results` is
not proof of absence, and no non-`ok` status is final evidence.

The adapter redacts API keys and other secret-like values from emitted JSON and
does not return a full raw provider response. Never put a key in JSON, shell
history, or an artifact. Each paid call is a bounded pilot or explicitly
budgeted expansion; do not automatically retry a timeout, 202, provider error,
or uncertain paid outcome. Keep Deepline and ScrapingDog credit caps separate.
Treat the estimates above as planning values and confirm the current plan.
Record each exact-call bound and provider status in the route receipt. Set
unknown usage and unknown bounds to `null` rather than `0`.
