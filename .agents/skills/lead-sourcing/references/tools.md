Choose by the missing evidence, company identity, geography and budget. These
are useful starting points, not a fixed sequence or exhaustive allowlist.

## Choose by evidence gap

### Signals and qualification facts

Funding stage is a company fact; a newly announced round is an event. PR and
social media are [source channels](#source-channels), not automatic intent.
Interpret all evidence against the actual request.

## Use the guide without extra work

- Search a short provider/capability phrase with `tyche_inspect(query=...)`.
  Seeds above are searches, not executable IDs. Choose the returned tool;
  `tyche_inspect(tool=...)` supplies cached inputs, access and pricing.
- Start with sources suited to the missing fact. Reuse successful receipts.
  Inspect saved raw detail when summaries omit fields; do not pay again for it.
- Use the shared strategy-change rule in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md#research-loop)
  when reviewed attempts stall. These rows offer alternatives, not a mandatory
  provider order; public research and structured lookups are both valid choices.
- Preserve source identity, dates and claim strength. No results means unknown,
  not failed fit. Catalog metadata and generated summaries are not evidence.

Use existing [native tools](adapter-io.md#native-tools),
[Deepline contracts](deepline-adapter.md) and
[ScrapingDog operations](scrapingdog-adapter.md#scrapingdog-wrapper).
Schemas, prices, native limits and access are checked live, not copied here.
Categories are not permissions; disconnected, monitor-only or
[vendor-only](provider-capabilities.md#documented-only-not-local-operations)
capabilities are not executable alternatives. Other useful approved reads can
be discovered dynamically. Preserve qualification, budget, uncertain-charge,
identity-before-email and stopping rules; no outreach or new subscriptions.
