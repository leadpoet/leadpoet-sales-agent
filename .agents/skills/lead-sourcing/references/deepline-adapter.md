# Deepline adapter

Normal sourcing uses [native tools](adapter-io.md#native-tools), which supply
envelopes, descriptions, receipts and accounting. These wrapper contracts are
diagnostics, not setup work for every lookup. Read [Capability discovery](#capability-discovery)
for search ideas and the [ZeroBounce gate](#deepline-zerobounce-email-gate)
before validating email; read [BounceBan fallback](#bounceban-fallback) only
when catch-all/unknown or a ZeroBounce service failure requires it.
No other validator replaces these gates.

## Deepline wrapper

`scripts/deepline.py` uses the installed CLI for tool discovery, schemas and
prices. Execution uses Deepline's API directly with `DEEPLINE_API_KEY` or the
existing production SDK login (nearest matching `.env.deepline`, then
`~/.local/deepline/code-deepline-com/.env`). This preserves HTTP error bodies,
request IDs and explicit bills without changing authentication or saving keys
in artifacts. Custom CLI hosts/binaries retain the CLI path. Neither path retries
uncertain executions. A completed upstream error with explicit billing can
settle even when the provider operation timed out; a local timeout stays pending.
A missing charge stays unresolved until an authoritative receipt is available; a validation
error alone does not prove a zero charge. A catalog
hit is not company or contact evidence. A disconnected tool is not an empty
result.

The isolated supervisor waits up to 120 seconds for delayed, attributable bills,
within the original sourcing deadline and saved billing-read allowance. This
uses only billing reads, without model turns or paid-call retries. Missing
request IDs are recorded in `billing-status.json` with an explicit recovery
requirement; waiting or repeating the paid request cannot safely repair them.
For calls with a dispatch-bound catalog, settlement and audit verify the saved
descriptor hash before using its provider or operation aliases.

### Network access

The native tool process and its CLI subprocess use the same workspace permission
profile and provider-domain allowlist as the worker. A failed native call is not
permission to rerun it through an unrestricted shell. For diagnostic CLI use,
the wrapper and its subprocess inherit the host's network restrictions.
When network access is restricted, use the supported approved execution path
for Deepline calls. In Codex, request `sandbox_permissions: "require_escalated"`
with a scoped justification on the host execution tool; this is not a shell
flag or Deepline request field. Reuse applicable existing approvals.

`NETWORK_ERROR`, `fetch failed`, and `Could not resolve host` can reflect local
sandbox restrictions. Before declaring Deepline unavailable, check execution
permissions and retry a no-cost catalog `search` or `describe` through the
approved path. A successful health check alone does not establish catalog
access. Save both attempt receipts. If catalog access succeeds, remove resolved
access blockers, rerun the stop check, and continue eligible work with the
existing budget, start time, and reservations.

If approval is denied, preserve the denial and affected action, honor that
boundary, and continue unaffected work. Do not change global sandbox or DNS
settings or pin host IPs as a workaround. If approved execution still fails,
record that evidence and leave the cause uncertain unless further diagnostics
establish it.

Use free catalog calls for connectivity diagnostics. Never retry a paid
`execute` whose remote outcome is uncertain; preserve its receipt and spend
reservation even when a later catalog check succeeds.

### Capability discovery

Search the live catalog with narrow seeds that match the hypothesis. These are
search seeds, not fixed IDs; use only the tool ID returned by the current search:

- `companies with current hiring or job postings`
- `companies with recent funding, press, or product news`
- `companies with paid advertising or campaign activity`
- `companies with recent patents, facilities, openings, or expansion`
- `companies with official video or event activity`
- `company firmographic search by industry geography and size`
- `people by company domain and requested job title`
- `current title roster or leadership team by company domain`
- `ZeroBounce validate one known email address`

Use the [evidence-gap map](tools.md#choose-by-evidence-gap) and its linked
capability reference for broader seeds. Search by provider plus the missing capability. Do not restrict discovery
to catalog categories: useful public-data reads can be labeled `admin`, while
an `automation` result can be a paid research job. Inspect the actual contract
and side effects; neither category grants execution permission.

Learn each selected tool once with `tyche_inspect(tool=...)`. Native tools save
and reuse its description, then check its inputs, connection and price before
dispatch. Refresh only after evidence that the saved contract or access changed.
Prefer a title-roster tool for nuanced roles. If that is unavailable, use broad function and seniority with
the full user-approved title family. Ignore non-callable or monitor-only search
hits for this one-shot workflow; do not deploy monitors. Do not use a CEO as an
automatic fallback.

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/deepline.py --input '{"operation":"search","query":"companies with current hiring or job postings"}'
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/deepline.py --input '{"operation":"describe","tool":"<id returned by search>"}'
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/deepline.py --input-file 'reports/<run-id>/requests/<route-id>.json'
```

The execute request file includes `operation`, `tool`, `payload`, and the
required [spend context](adapter-io.md#paid-call-budget). `execute` is paid.
A company-discovery pilot has one paid call and at most 10 returned rows;
contact lookups request only the remaining relevant people needed for that company's minimum/target.
All returned execute rows are retained. Native lookup/inspect displays ten rows
at a time; use its `next_offset` to inspect the rest without another paid call.
The wrapper `limit` does not limit provider billing; set provider-native result/count and page or cursor fields from the live schema,
then bound the cost before execution. Inspect the live price first; expand only
when rows are relevant, diverse, and evidentiary. The wrapper invokes
`deepline tools search`, `describe`, or
`execute`, writes a temporary payload file, redacts secrets, and emits one JSON
object. Catalog calls default to 30 seconds (cap 120); execute calls
default to 240 seconds (cap 780). Never automatically retry an uncertain paid call.
After each execute, use billed usage as `cost_credits` with
`cost_basis: "actual"`. If billed usage is unavailable but the live description
gives a conservative bound for all calls recorded by the route, use
`cost_credits: null`, that total bound as
`cost_upper_bound_credits`, and `cost_basis: "estimated"`. Use `unknown` with
both values `null` only when neither value is available.
A typical or midpoint price is not a conservative bound. Use `unknown` when
unresolved pricing inputs can make the route cost higher.

When Deepline supplies billing, the adapter preserves finite, non-negative
`billing.credits_charged` and `billing.cost_usd`. These are observed amounts,
not estimates inferred from row counts. Missing billing stays missing; keep
the conservative bound until an actual charge is available.

The wrapper normalizes candidate fields to `company`, `domain`, `signal`,
`evidence_url`, `evidence_date`, `evidence_text`, `provider`, and `tool`.
Generic labels such as `search_result`, `web_page`, `company_profile`, and
`hiring` are discovery labels only. For web-search rows, `domain` can be the
source host; resolve the canonical company domain before acceptance.

Successful scraped pages retain their metadata, source URL and Markdown/HTML
content as `web_page` evidence with `content_format`, including pages inside
result lists. Qualification checks use the captured URL, body and date metadata
regardless of the crawler's name; failed or empty HTTP captures cannot qualify.
HTML remains HTML: inspect
its actual fields before writing plain-language qualification evidence. A page
is not a qualified company or buyer. Recover response-shape errors from saved
raw responses without another provider call; preserve the original receipt and
record any local normalization continuation with zero new calls and no duplicate
charge.
FullEnrich people-search responses expose `toolResponse.rawV2.people` as discovery
records and retain `metadata.search_after` as the pagination cursor. Current
employment and profile URLs are preserved; these results do not replace buyer
identity, current-profile or email verification.

For required [LinkedIn location and company size](output-contract.md#linkedin-location-and-company-size),
use the matched URL with the live HarvestAPI company/profile getters. The adapter
preserves the raw response and exposes `employee_range` from `employeeCountRange`,
and `country`, `state`, `city`, `location_text` from the person's own `location`.
It does not derive a range from `employeeCount` or a city from a broad region.
Save field evidence with the exact getter's tool/route ID before accepting a lead.
Reference response shapes: [company](https://elrix.mintlify.app/linkedin-api-reference/company/get)
and [person](https://elrix.mintlify.app/linkedin-api-reference/profile/get).

For recognized event and post envelopes, the wrapper retains optional
top-level `pagination`, `meta`, and `links` metadata with secrets redacted.
HarvestAPI's known `pagination.paginationToken` is exposed separately as
`pagination.next_cursor`. Map this opaque cursor back to the live provider
input field only for an explicitly budgeted continuation; paging is never
automatic. Review the complete saved page with inspect before purchasing another.
Older preview-only receipts can also be inspected in full without redispatch.

HarvestAPI post rows retain the post URL, content, `postedAt`, and author.
Verify the author, company, and original versus reposted source; the author is
not automatically a current employee or buyer. A person-authored post does
not establish the author's employer, and a company-authored post does not
establish its canonical domain.

For JSON:API event responses, relationship names such as `company1` and
`company2` are retained in `related_companies`. Related companies are
candidates, not accepted companies: resolve the relationship and account gate
explicitly, never pick the first company. Use a linked source `published_at`
for `evidence_date` when available, keep any effective `event_date` separately,
and never treat ingestion fields such as `found_at` or `updated` as event
freshness.

### Deepline status contract

The wrapper emits exactly: `ok`, `no_results`, `partial`, `rate_limited`,
`auth_failed`, `quota_exceeded`, `timeout`, `schema_error`, `provider_error`,
or `config_error`. Only `ok` and `partial` can supply candidates. `no_results`
does not prove absence. Other statuses are unresolved provider outcomes; stop or
change route and retain `status`, `error` when present, `provider`, `operation`,
`tool`, and normalized `results` in the report.

## Email validation

### BounceBan fallback

After ZeroBounce returns `catch-all`/`unknown`, or its execution returns
`provider_error` (including `NETWORK_ERROR`), `timeout`, `rate_limited`,
`auth_failed`, or `quota_exceeded` without a usable verdict, search the live
catalog for `BounceBan verify single email` and describe the returned tool. Execute once
with the exact email and `entity_type: email_validation`, reserving the current
price against the existing dollar and provider credit caps, plus any explicitly
requested per-next-lead cap. Do not
pin the tool ID or price. Keep catch-all verification enabled. Default to
regular mode: deepverify assumes the email domain matches the current company
website, which is not safe for all verified brand/alias domains. No webhook
or outreach is needed.

Read raw `result`, not API `status`. Acceptance requires API `success` and
`result: deliverable`; risky/unknown is unresolved, undeliverable is rejected.
The adapter exposes the verdict as `email_status` while retaining raw fields.
Store status/result, optional score/time and the Deepline source in the
original receipt's `fallback` object. Never overwrite the ZeroBounce receipt.
For a service failure, store ZeroBounce `status: null` and `provider_status`
matching its failed execution route; do not invent `unknown` as an email verdict.
Preserve the failed route's reservation as well as the fallback's charge. A
schema/input error, local permission/budget refusal, or missing attempt receipt
does not qualify. The fallback is a separate paid call, not a ZeroBounce retry.
If BounceBan also fails, keep the address unresolved and continue other useful
work. A local network error alone does not prove a downstream provider outage.
Do not override invalid, do_not_mail, spamtrap or abuse. An unsuccessful or
uncertain call stays unresolved; do not retry it automatically or chain
validators. Choose another address or requested buyer instead.

An asynchronous `queue`/`verifying` response is `partial` with empty results
and `pending_verification` containing the existing job ID. It is not an empty
search or a deliverability verdict. Preserve this receipt. The model may
discover and describe the single-status retrieval tool and, only after
confirming it is free, retrieve that same job ID. Match the returned ID and
email before using a successful final verdict; save the completion receipt
separately with its zero cost bound and guarded dispatch count. Use the
`status_read` action flag from [shared I/O](adapter-io.md#one-attempt); every
`execute` is counted by the guard even when priced free. The fallback
source references the completed status receipt; retain the original submission
and its automatically recorded continuation link.
Respect `try_again_at`, allow at most three status reads with at least 30
seconds between reads, and leave a still-pending job unresolved. Never create
another paid verification to recover a pending job. The adapter itself does
not poll or retry.

Finalization allows a catalog-confirmed free status getter for a pending
verification submitted in this run, including after the research deadline.
The getter must match the saved job, provider and company; it cannot submit
another verification or extend the clock. An unused pending address remains
unfinished in the audit with its cost reservation preserved. It does not block
export of other addresses with completed, matching verification receipts.

An outer transport/auth/provider failure must not be promoted by a nested
positive validator row. Only the explicitly recognized default send-policy
rejection may retain a non-positive ZeroBounce verdict for the normal gate.

### Deepline ZeroBounce email gate

When the effective contact fields include email, first find and verify the
person and current role. Use the saved ZeroBounce single-address validation
capability prepared at startup. Inspect its inputs once if needed; reuse its
description and successful same-address receipts. Search the live catalog only
if that capability is unavailable or has changed. Native tools check the saved
contract and price before dispatch; the catalog tool ID remains runtime data.

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/deepline.py --input '{"operation":"search","query":"ZeroBounce validate one known email address"}'
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/deepline.py --input '{"operation":"describe","tool":"<current ZeroBounce validation tool from search>"}'
python3 .agents/skills/lead-sourcing/scripts/deepline.py --input '{"operation":"execute","tool":"<same described tool>","entity_type":"email_validation","payload":{"email":"person@example.com"},"limit":1}'
```

Use the exact payload names returned by the live description; the example
shows the current scalar shape but does not override the live schema. The
adapter preserves the provider row and exposes `email`, `email_status`, and
`email_sub_status` for a recognized scalar validation result. Link the final
receipt to a unique `email_validation` route and record actual usage.

Apply TYCHE's current gate to the explicit ZeroBounce status after trimming and
case normalization. `valid` passes directly. Reject `invalid`, `do_not_mail`,
`spamtrap`, and `abuse` without fallback. `catch-all`/`unknown` and the recorded
service failures above may receive one BounceBan check. Unfamiliar verdicts stay unresolved.
Continue with another discovered address or requested buyer.
A missing status, `no_results`, provider error, timeout, or other uncertain
call cannot pass by itself; the eligible service failures may use BounceBan.
Do not retry an
uncertain paid validation call automatically. Deepline owns the provider
credential; do not require or read a direct ZeroBounce key.
